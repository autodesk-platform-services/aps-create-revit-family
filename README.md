# Main Parts of The Work
1. Migrate the existing Revit WindowWizard Plugin to be used within AppBundle of Design Automation for Revit. Please check [PlugIn](./CreateWindow/PlugIn/) 

2. Refer ([https://youtu.be/1NCeH7acIko](https://youtu.be/1NCeH7acIko)) and simply use the `Configure` button in the Web Application to create the Appbundle & Activity. 

3. Create the Web App to call the workitem.

# Web App Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **APS Account**: Learn how to create a APS Account, activate subscription and create an app at [this tutorial](http://aps.autodesk.com/tutorials). 
2. **Visual Code**: Visual Code (Windows or MacOS)
3. **ngrok**: Routing tool, [download here](https://ngrok.com/)
4. **Revit 2023**: required to compile changes into the plugin
5. **Window family template**: A family template that is required while creating window family, you can use this [sample template](./CreateWindow/WindowFamily.rft)
6. **JavaScript ES6** syntax for server-side
7. **JavaScript** basic knowledge with **jQuery**


For using this sample, you need an Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [APS Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use **http://localhost:3000/api/aps/callback/oauth** as Callback URL, although is not used on 2-legged flow. Finally take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Running locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), version 14 or newer.

Clone this project or download it (this `nodejs` branch only). It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone -b nodejs https://github.com/Autodesk-Platform-Services/aps-create-revit-family

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned and use the following:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export APS_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export APS_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    export APS_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL>>
    export APS_WEBHOOK_URL=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT CALLBACK URL>>
    export DESIGN_AUTOMATION_NICKNAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT NICK NAME>>
    export DESIGN_AUTOMATION_ACTIVITY_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT ACTIVITY NAME>>
    export DESIGN_AUTOMATION_ACTIVITY_ALIAS=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT ACTIVITY ALIAS>>    
    export DESIGN_AUTOMATION_FAMILY_TEMPLATE=<<YOUR REVIT WINDOW FAMILY TEMPLATE FILE URL>>    
    npm start

Windows (use **Node.js command line** from Start menu)

    npm install
    set APS_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set APS_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    set APS_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL>>
    set APS_WEBHOOK_URL=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT CALLBACK URL>>
    set DESIGN_AUTOMATION_NICKNAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT NICK NAME>>
    set DESIGN_AUTOMATION_ACTIVITY_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT ACTIVITY NAME>>
    set DESIGN_AUTOMATION_ACTIVITY_ALIAS=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT ACTIVITY ALIAS>>
    set DESIGN_AUTOMATION_FAMILY_TEMPLATE=<<YOUR REVIT WINDOW FAMILY TEMPLATE FILE URL>>    
    npm start

**Note.**
environment variable examples:
- APS_CALLBACK_URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/aps/callback/oauth`
- APS_WEBHOOK_URL: `http://808efcdc123456.ngrok.io/api/aps/callback/designautomation`

The following are optional:
- DESIGN_AUTOMATION_NICKNAME: Only necessary if there is a nickname, APS client id by default.
- DESIGN_AUTOMATION_ACTIVITY_NAME: Only necessary if the activity name is customized, CreateWindowAppActivity by default.
- DESIGN_AUTOMATION_ACTIVITY_ALIAS: Only necessary if the activity alias is customized, dev by default.


### ngrok
Run `ngrok http 3000` to create a tunnel to your local machine, then copy the address into the `APS_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable. Please check [WebHooks](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/webhooks/v1/tutorials/configuring-your-server/) for details. 

### Start the app
Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), the way to create a window family should be straightforwd, just follow the steps:
1. Select window style, either `Double Hung`, `Fixed`, or `Sliding Double`
2. Add a couple of family types, and change the parameters accordingly, set the material for `Glass Pane` and `Sash`, and change the family file name if necessary
3. Select a folder in your BIM360 project, the new created family file will be saved there
4. Click the Create button, and see the result in BIM360

`Note`: When you deploy the app, you have to open the `Configure` button to create the AppBundle & Activity before running the Export|Import feature, please check the video for the steps at [https://youtu.be/1NCeH7acIko](https://youtu.be/1NCeH7acIko)

## Deployment

To deploy this application to Heroku, the **Callback URL** for APS must use your `.herokuapp.com` address. After clicking on the button below, at the Heroku Create New App page, set your Client ID, Secret, Callback URL and Revit Design Automation variables for APS.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Autodesk-Platform-Services/aps-create-revit-family)

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqa9O20Gj0c) as reference on how to deploy samples to Heroku.


## Packages used

The [Autodesk APS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis) packages is included by default. Some other non-Autodesk packaged are used, including [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for upload.

- [BIM 360 API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview/) and [App Provisioning](https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps)

## Tips & Tricks
- The Window family template which is used to create the family should be uploaded first.
- Before using the sample to call the workitem, you need to setup your Appbundle & Activity of Design Automation, you can simply use the `Configure` button in the Web Application to create the Appbundle & Activity([https://youtu.be/1NCeH7acIko](https://youtu.be/1NCeH7acIko)). 

## Limitation
- Not support multiple version of the new created family, change the family name is it's already existed under the folder, or create|select a new folder for the same name of Revit family file.
- Only US region is supported, EU region is not supported currently.

## Troubleshooting

After installing Github desktop for Windows, on the Git Shell, if you see a ***error setting certificate verify locations*** error, use the following:

    git config --global http.sslverify "false"
